# Gogle App Engine Launcher Project File
# http://code.google.com/appengine
#
# App Engine Portable Notes:
#
# Use relative paths to keep the application fully portable and relocatable.
# Current work directory:
#   App\google_appengine\launcher
#
# For portable use its recommended to keep the development application source
# on the same drive, but outside of the \PortableApps directory.
# In this case just omit the leading drive-letter (X:\gae\application_id) and
# use drive-relative absolute path (\gae\application_id) instead.
#
# Drive letters path will be dynamically updated by the launcher.
# Replacement rules configured in the file:
#   App\AppInfo\Launcher\AppEngine_Python25.ini
#
# Datastore by default will be App\Data\Temp\dev_appserver.datastore
# Temp will be erased on every start, multiple apps share same datastore
#
# Example flags for guestbook, uses relative path, portable and relocatable:
# flag0 = --use_sqlite
# flag1 = --datastore_path=..\..\..\Data\Temp\guestbook.sqlite
#
