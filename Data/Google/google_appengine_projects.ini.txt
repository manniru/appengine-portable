# Gogle App Engine Launcher Project File
# http://code.google.com/appengine
#
# GAEPyPortable Notes:
#
# Relative paths keep the application fully portable and relocatable.
# Current work directory:
# App\google_appengine\launcher
#
# Any drive letter and path will be dynamically updated by the launcher.
# Replacement rules configured in the file:
# App\AppInfo\Launcher\AppEngine_Python.ini
#
# Datastore by default will be App\Data\Temp\dev_appserver.datastore
# Temp will be erased on every start, multiple apps share same datastore
#
# Example flags for guestbook, relative, portable and relocatable:
# flag0 = --use_sqlite
# flag1 = --datastore_path=..\..\..\Data\Temp\guestbook.sqlite
#
