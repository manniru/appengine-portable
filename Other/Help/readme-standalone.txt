<h2>Google App Engine 1.6.1 SDK Python 2.5 Win32 Portable</h2>
<small>Archive type: WinRAR with Self-Extractor GUI (*.SFX.RAR.EXE)</small>
<pre>
This archive contains the folder (directory tree) '<code>AppEngine_Python25</code>',
which is by default extracted into the current directory.

Recommended path for extraction is the directory <code>\PortableApps\</code>,
preferably on the drive of your portable media.

<b>Upgrade Notes:</b>

Extracting this archive into existing folder will overwrite projects
defined in the GUI.
The only file which needs to be backed up and restored is:

<code>AppEngine_Python25\Data\py25\Google\google_appengine_projects.ini</code>

Its recommended to use the Online Installer since non-critical
updates will be only available via new installer releases.

This archive is also downloaded as part of the Online Installer
and usually updated only after release of a new GAE SDK version.
