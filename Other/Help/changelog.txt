(tester for py27 are welcome and might spped up things)

1.5.5:

PIL (Python Image Library) fixed, requires some *.py to exist
Icons for PortableApps.com Menu
Precompiled: will work *only* with (included) Python version 2.5.4

1.5.4:

Application name changed from 'AppEngine_Python' to 'AppEngine_Python25'
since Google will soon support also Python 2.7 with multithreading.
This way both releases may coexist without confusion.
Rename the directory (and the executables in the root) to whatever.

New tools added in application root: (just remove them if not needed)
Development_Editor.exe serves as minimalistic, portablish IDE
Python25_Console.exe with environment set for appengine-portable
Python25_Documentation.chm offline manual
Windows_Console.exe with environment set for appengine-portable

1.5.3:

All *.py have been precompiled into *.pyc, and most of them removed.
Please report any issues (such as *.py not found) via bug tracker.

Application name has changed from 'GAEPyPortable' to 'AppEngine_Python'.
Friendlier usability, but violates the PortableApps.com Specifications.
Users of the portable installer may still choose any folder name.

Testing different standalone archive format, including SFX.
PortableApps.com Installer handles them all.

For upgrades configuration files in Data\Google should be backed up.
Use the portable installer instead to handle this case automatically.
