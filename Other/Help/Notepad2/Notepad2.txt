Regular Expression Syntax

  .      Matches any character

  \(     This marks the start of a region for tagging a match.

  \)     This marks the end of a tagged region.

  \n     Where n is 1 through 9 refers to the first through ninth
         tagged region when replacing. For example, if the search
         string was Fred\([1-9]\)XXX and the replace string was
         Sam\1YYY, when applied to Fred2XXX this would generate
         Sam2YYY.

  \<     This matches the start of a word.

  \>     This matches the end of a word.

  \x     This allows you to use a character x that would otherwise
         have a special meaning. For example, \[ would be interpreted
         as [ and not as the start of a character set.

  [...]  This indicates a set of characters, for example, [abc] means
         any of the characters a, b or c. You can also use ranges, for
         example [a-z] for any lower case character.

  [^...] The complement of the characters in the set. For example,
         [^A-Za-z] means any character except an alphabetic character.

  ^      This matches the start of a line (unless used inside a set,
         see above).

  $      This matches the end of a line.

  *      This matches 0 or more times. For example, Sa*m matches Sm,
         Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.

  +      This matches 1 or more times. For example, Sa+m matches Sam,
         Saam, Saaam and so on.

  \d     Any decimal digit.
  \D     Any character that is not a decimal digit.

  \s     Any whitespace character.
  \S     Any character that is not a whitespace character.

  \w     Any "word" character.
  \W     Any "non-word" character.

  \xHH   Character with hex code HH.

  -----> Examples (don't use quotes)
         - Quote lines: find "^" replace with "> "
         - Unquote lines: find "^> " replace with ""
         - Remove line numbers: find "^[0-9]+" replace with ""
         - Convert tabs to double spaces: find "\t" replace with "  "

Feature Requests

  Thank you very much for the overwhelming feedback about Notepad2!
  Feature requests are always welcome, but please keep in mind that
  Notepad2 has been designed as a compact Notepad replacement.

  Hyperlink support is currently not provided by the Scintilla source
  code editing component (and not planned), it's unlikely I will
  implement this.

  Notepad replacement is easier said than done, I'm sorry! Instructions
  on how to replace Notepad on various versions of Windows can be found
  around in the net.


Credits and Special Thanks

  Here I would like to say "THANK YOU" to the developers of the great
  Scintilla source code editing component (http://www.scintilla.org),
  which is the core of Notepad2. Without Scintilla, the rich features
  found in Notepad2 wouldn't have been possible!

  Many thanks to everybody for sending me bug reports and useful hints.
  A special thank goes to Roland Weigelt (http://www.roland-weigelt.de)
  for his helpful thoughts and comments about Notepad2 features and
  usability in early development stages. I'd also like to express my
  thanks to Timo Kunze (www.TimoSoft-Software.de) for sending detailed
  bug reports and patches.
