Standard installation using the Portable Installer:

Download and run the file AppEngine_Python_*_online.paf.exe instead.
This archive will be downloaded automagically by the portable installer,
or may be placed into the same directory for offline installation.

----

Manual Installation:
 
Unpacking this archive creates the directory 'AppEngine_Python'.
Open this folder and click on the portable executable 'AppEngine_Python.exe'.
You may try out the demo guestbook and the SDK console without any further
configuration, just add your own projects and go ahead.


Changelog/Upgrade Notes:

a)
All *.py have been precompiled into *.pyc, and most of them removed.
Please report any issues (such as *.py not found) via bug tracker.

b)
Application name has changed from 'GAEPyPortable' to 'AppEngine_Python'.
Friendlier usability, but violates the PortableApps.com Specifications.
Users of the portable installer may still choose any folder name.

c)
Development_Editor.exe serves as minimalistic, portablish IDE

d)
Testing different standalone archive format, including SFX.
PortableApps.com Installer handles them all.

e)
For upgrades configuration files in Data\Google should be backed up.
Use the portable installer instead to handle this case automatically.
